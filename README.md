# `yr` - a lightweight multi-stack programming language

`yr` is a **domain-specific language (DSL)** designed to streamline multi-stack development projects. Built for frontend, backend, and DevOps workflows, it merges stacks such as HTML, CSS, JS, Bash, and Python into a single cohesive language. It eliminates the need for heavy frameworks and excessive boilerplate by using indentation-based syntax, reusable macros, and modular wrapper files.

## Purpose

The goal of `yr` is to:

- Eliminate repetitive HTML and project boilerplate
- Provide reusable macros and components
- Enable seamless cross-stack scripting and code generation
- Offer a developer-friendly syntax based on indentation and triggers
- Simplify dev workflows across frontend, backend, and DevOps
